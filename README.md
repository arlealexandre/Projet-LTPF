```
You can find the files compatible with an emacs execution in ./analyseurLexicalSyntaxique
And you will be able to execute area program in ./areaWhile
(the files in this directory are the same as in analyseurLexicalSyntaxique
but with import replaced by open to help the compilation)
```

## Area stands for AlexandreRémiEminAxel Programming language

  
First, go in areaWhile/ directory
```

cd areaWhile/

```

  Then, compile area program using make command, there is already premade little programme like fibonnaci or a solution to the day 6 part 2 problem of advent of code

```

make

```

  You are now able to execute area program !

```

./area.byte

OR

./area.byte <file_path_of_.ar_program>

OR

./area.byte --interactive <file_path_of_.ar_program>
```
